        <h1>How to Play PANTS</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to PANTS, the online game that's all about creativity, quick thinking, and fun! If you're new to PANTS, don't worry - we've got you covered. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:
        </p><br /><br />

        <h2>Step 1: Choose a Letter</h2>
        <p>
          The game begins with a randomly selected letter. You can choose to play with the default letter or select a new one from our library. Click on the "New Letter" button to generate a new letter.
        </p><br /><br />

        <h2>Step 2: Fill in the Categories</h2>
        <p>
          Your goal is to come up with words that fit into five categories:
          <ul className="step-list">
            <li>Place: A location, city, country, or landmark</li>
            <li>Animal: A type of animal, pet, or creature</li>
            <li>Name: A first name, last name, or nickname</li>
            <li>Thing: An object, item, or thing</li>
            <li>Score: A number or score</li >
          </ul>
        </p><br /><br />

        <h2>Step 3: Enter Your Answers</h2>
        <p>
          Type in your answers for each category in the corresponding text fields. You can take as much time as you need, but be warned - the clock is ticking!
        </p><br /><br />

        <h2>Step 4: Submit Your Answers</h2>
        <p>
          Once you've filled in all the categories, click the "Submit" button to submit your answers.
        </p><br /><br />

        <h2>Step 5: Compare with Others</h2>
        <p>
          After submitting your answers, you'll see how your responses match up with those of other players. You'll earn points for each unique answer that no one else has submitted.
        </p><br /><br />

        <h2>Step 6: Earn Points and Badges</h2>
        <p>
          The more unique answers you come up with, the more points you'll earn. You'll also have the chance to unlock badges and achievements as you progress through the game.
        </p><br /><br />

        <h2>Step 7: Play Again and Again</h2>
        <p>
          The game doesn't end here! You can play as many rounds as you like, trying out different letters and categories to challenge yourself and your friends.
